# JUnit Tests

- JUnit test is a framework that allows us to write repeatable tests.
- This allows us to write a test for our code and update our code depending on if our code passes the test or not. 
- If you are not getting the expected results from the test then you can fix your actual program.


- My Example for JUnit Tests:

##### Loan Example (https://github.com/Ilizaliturri-Albert/CIT360/blob/master/JUnit-Tests/Loan.java)
##### JUnit Test for Loan File (https://github.com/Ilizaliturri-Albert/CIT360/blob/master/JUnit-Tests/LoanTest.java)
