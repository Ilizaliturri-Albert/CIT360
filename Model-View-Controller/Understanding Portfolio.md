# Model View Controller Pattern

- The MVC is a design pattern that assigns objects in an app to one of three roles. 
- This pattern is used to seperate application concerns.
- Model: this represents data and the rules that direct access as well as updates the data. 
- View: this show the content of what is in the Model. 
- Controller: this translates the user interaction with the view. 


- My Example of MVC:
