# Hibernate

- Hibernate is an object-relational mapping framework for Java. 
- It is a framework for mapping an object-oriented model to a database. 
- Hibernate is a free software. 
- Hibernate mapes Java classes to Database tables, as well to map Java data types to SQL data types.
- Hibernate is how we connect our java programing to a database for items that need to be stored for the application. 


- My Example of Hibernate: this code I received from Brother Barneys text book. Here I connected it to my website database and I can store user information.
