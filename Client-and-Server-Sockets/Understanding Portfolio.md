# Client and Server Sockets

- Client and server is a program relationship in which one program requests a service or resource from another program. 
- Client and server model can be used by programs within a single computer. 
- The client establishes a connection to a server over the internet. 
- Once the server has fulfilled the clients request, the connection is terminated. 
- Client programs and server programs are often part of a larger program or app.
- The reason is because MULTIPLE client programs share the services of the same server.
