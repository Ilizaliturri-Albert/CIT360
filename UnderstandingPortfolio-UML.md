# Use Case Diagram

-	Describe actions of user and system
-	Actor: User or System interacting with modeled system
-	Use Case: External view of system that represents an action of a user.
	
# When to Use

-	Help expose requirements when planning the project.

# How to Draw

-	Actor: Stick person with label of role.
-	Use Case: Circle with label of action

# State Diagram

-	Describe behavior of a system.
-	Describes all possible states of one object (usually) as events occur

## When to Use
-	Use state diagrams to show object behavior through many use cases.
-	Not useful for describing collaboration of all objects in use case.
-	Not as useful for objects not used through entire system.

## How to Draw

### State Element: Rounded boxes representing object's state
-	Titled with state name
-	Activity section, show activities that object does in this state

### Initial state
-	Dot representing objects conditions when created

###Transitions
-	Arrows indicate transition to next state

###Super state
-	Surrounds state elements to show a state that applies to many elements.
-	Useful to keep diagram easy to read.

# Sequence Diagram

-	Describe the way groups of objects interact to complete tasks.
-	Interactions shown as methods

## When to Use
-	To Model behavior of several objects in a use case
## How to Draw
-	Describe objects and messages they pass to one another
-	Diagrams go left to right
-	Each object written above vertical line
-	Arrows show methods and messages passed to objects

# Activity Diagram 
-	Describe workflow behavior of a system.
-	Can show condition or parallel activities

## When to Use
-	Models workflow of system to give a "big picture"
-	Don't describe detail about how objects behave or how objects collaborate.
## How to Draw
-	Read from top to bottom
-	Start: Dot at top
-	Circle: Activity
-	Bar: Fork or Join
-	Triangle: Condition
