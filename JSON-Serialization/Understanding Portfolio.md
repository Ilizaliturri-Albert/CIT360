# JSON Serialization

Serialization means that is converts an object to a string. 
- We use serialization inorder to store and transfer complex objects to and from a file. 
- For more control over how an object is serialized, the JsonSerializer can be used. 
- The JsonSerializer is able to read and write JSON text directly to a using JsonTextReader and JsonTextWriter.

#### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

It allows several different types of elements. The mosted used are arrays and objects. 
- Arrays in JSON are  within Square Bracktes.
- The elements in the array are sepreated with a comma.
